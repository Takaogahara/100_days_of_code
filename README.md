# 100 Days of Code

Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.

## Goals

- Learn more about image processing and its applications;  
- Learn more about machine learning;
- Be able to teach someone these subjects, at least a bit.

## Subjects

The subjects will be divided in different repositories for better organization.  
During the challenge I'll study these topics:

1. Image Processing  
  1. Theoretical topics in "Digital Image Processing - Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods";  
  2. Applications with OpenCV library.  
    1. Filters;
    2. Edge detection;
    3. Image segmentation;
    4. Morphological operations;
    5. Clustering;
    6. Others.

2. Machine Learning and Data Science
  1. Statistics for machine learning;  
  2. "Types" of Machine Learning and its algorithms;
  3. Metrics;
  4. Deep Learning;
  5. Collect and obtain data;
  6. Data processing using Hadoop;
  7. Practice with Kaggle competitions.

3. Computer Vision  
  1. Real time video processing;  
  2. Real time video processing with machine learning methods.

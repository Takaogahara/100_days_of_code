# 100 Days of Code

Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.

## Goals

- Learn more about image processing and its applications;  
- Learn more about machine learning;
- Be able to teach someone these subjects, at least a bit.

## Subjects

The subjects will be divided in different repositories for better organization.  
During the challenge I'll study these topics:

1. Image Processing  
  - Theoretical topics in "Digital Image Processing - Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods";  
  - Applications with OpenCV library.  
    - Filters;  
    - Edge detection;  
    - Image segmentation;  
    - Morphological operations;  
    - Clustering;  
    - Others.  
    
2. Machine Learning and Data Science  
  - Statistics for machine learning;  
  - "Types" of Machine Learning and its algorithms;  
  - Metrics;  
  - Deep Learning;  
  - Collect and obtain data;  
  - Data processing using Hadoop;  
  - Practice with Kaggle competitions.  

3. Computer Vision  
  - Real time video processing;  
  - Real time video processing with machine learning methods.
